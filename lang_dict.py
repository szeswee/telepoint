obj["narrator"] = { "start": "[telegram_username] is in a lift. One would think the classy interior and soft soothing elevator music would have a calming effect on the nerves, but [telegram_username]'s heart was beating furiously. The next few minutes of social interaction would be normal of any human being, but [telegram_username] is different (or special, as mum and dad used to say). A bell chime signaled that the lift has reached the intended floor, and abruptly broke [telegram_username]'s imagination of all the possible scenarios that could go wrong in the following encounter. The door opens. [telegram_username] enters the large brightly lit room. There is a mahogany counter at the end of the room. [telegram_username] tries to recall what they were here for. Who are you? ",
 "customer": "Anxiety was no certainly no stranger to [telegramusername], it being one of the few constant friends throughout life. With great effort, [telegramusername] approached the counter and sees a large man sitting behind it, reading the local daily papers. 'HI, HOW CAN I HELP YOU?' the receptionist asked, without looking up from the papers. Mustering all the courage, [telegram_username] tries not to stutter... ",
 "provider": "An epiphany! Memories of universal domination and ruling over the others, setting rules and schedules. [telegram_username] stepped behind the desk and resumed their rightful position in the universe as the Right Honorable Service Provider, contemplating the breadth of their domain. What do you do next?.",
 "make": "'AN APPOINTMENT, YOU SAY,' boomed the receptionist. [telegram_username] trembles in their shoes as he brandished a great tome before you. He flipped to the final page, on it lay three dates. It seems you were just in time. Which of these dates would you pick?",
 "customdate": "'YOU'RE A CHEEKY LAD, EH? JUST THIS ONCE.' You're not sure whether to be glad that he didn't slap you silly for being audacious or be frightened by her booming voice. At least you get to pick a date. What'll it be? ",
 "notavailable": "'ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY PICK ANY DATE!' You're sure you've transgressed the unspoken rules of the receptionist now as she stares at you with those glowering eyes. You decide it would be better to pick a different date than to face her wrath. What'll it be?",
 "change": "'WHAT?' the receptionist grunted. 'I... I want to change an appointment' [telegram_username] answered a little louder, despite being sceptical that the receptionist did not hear the first time. 'WHICH ONE?' the receptionist asked, voice displaying signs of noticeable irritation. ",
 "cancel": "'",
 "noappt": "'NOTHING WILL COME OF NOTHING,' the receptionist proclaims. You're not sure if they are profound words of philosophy or merely a statement on the absence of scheduled appointments, but you get the feeling that it's the latter. You decide not to pursue the matter.",
 "nocmd": "[telegram_username]'s attempt at forcing the receptionist to respond to their idiotic commands were swiftly met with disappointment when their commands were met with non-compliance, and a sudden realisation that this entire journey had been a dream where someone was narrating their every move. It was merely a Telegram bot. They then praised the bot for its insightful and witty commentary into the nature of 'social interaction' with an artificial entity and the attention to detail in communicating such absurdities in narration, just as they were reading it aloud themselves." }
